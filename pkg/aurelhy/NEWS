= aurelhy News

== aurelhy version 1.0-4

* Added a function dist2sea() by Francois Delobel.

* More flexibility in the size of add.vars: can be on same grid as geotm, or
  same grid as the final landscape descriptors.

* To avoid confusion between the mask used to determine which points to
  consider and the mask used to select sectors for landscape predictors
  calculation, the latter one is renamed "window of analysis".
  
* mbord and mmask data are not strictly Morocco territory, but a landscape
  around Morocco that is the target of the example analysis. Corresponding
  help pages are modified accordingly.


== aurelhy version 1.0-3

* A bug in predict.aurelhy() (function checkCorner()) sometimes prevented
  correct selection of the closest corner in the DEM when a station is not
  exactly on a node, but very close to it (thanks Francois Delobel for the
  patch).

* A new argument in aurelhy(), resample.geomask indicate if the geomask object
  should be resampled (provided with same grid af the geomat object), or not,
  (provided with same grid as final interpolation).
  
* predict.aurelhy() can now accept argument v.fit = FALSE. In this case,
  residuals are not kriged. This saves computation when kriging is not required,
  e.g., when one look for best predictors in the regression. All methods appled
  to predict.aurelhy objects are adapted to cope with objects that do not have
  kriged residuals recorded.
  
* add.points() generic function added, and method for geomask: adds points
  that are outside of a geomask, but inside of the gris from a geopoints
  object. It allows to add stations that are close to, but outside the area of
  interest (useful for correct kriging of the residuals).


== aurelhy version 1.0-2

* A warning about coercion of double to logical in predict.aurelhy() is solved
  (the coercion was intended, but as it was implicit, R generated the warning)


== aurelhy version 1.0-1

* If a geoshapes object had no "shapes" attribute (like the 'mbord' example
  dataset), write.geoshapes() failed. Now the "shapes" data are reconstructed
  from the object itself, if missing.

* geopoints() incorrectly returned a 'geospoints' object. Corrected.

* read.geomask() returned an object of class c('geomask', 'matrix'), instead of
  c('geomask', 'geomat', 'matrix'). Corrected.

* read.geomask() lost the 'coords' attribute. Corrected.

* aurelhy() had sometimes a problem of recursive argument because of
  auremask = auremask(). The argument is renamed landmask. = auremask(); same
  for vgm = vgm() renamed vgmodel = vgm(). Idem in update() method. Finally,
  the regression model is now provided as a string instead than as a formula.


== aurelhy version 1.0-0

* This is the first comple version with all functions implemented!

* The update() method of 'aurelhy' object is now implemented, and the example
  is expanded to show how one can use it to explore various interpolation
  parameters easily

* plot(x, which = 7) graph for 'aurely.predict' object is now implemented

* aurelhy can now also handle a rectangular grid (auremask object)

* print() and plot() methods for a rectangular grid (auremask object) are now
  implemented

* auremask(type = "rectangular") calculated a grid of n-1 rectangles, corrected


== aurelhy version 0.1-6

* Complete AURELHY interpolation is implemented now for radial auremask. There
  are also print(), summary() and plot() methods for further diagnostic
  
* Interpolated geomat objects are extracted from aurelhy and aurelhy.predict
  objects using the as.geomat() method
  
* A new dataset, mrain, is added: it is rain data measured at 43 stations

* A complete example AURELHY interpolation is ready now in the ?aurelhy man page


== aurelhy version 0.1-5

* geopoints objects are added. They are more convenient to use than geoshapes
  to manipulate a series of variables measured at given georeferenced points
  (stations). There are also read.geopoints() and write.geopoints() function,
  as well as print() and points() methods
  
* An example geopoints object is added: mpet. It is PET measurements at various
  weather station on Morocoo's territory and around


== aurelhy version 0.1-4

* morocco and mmask datasets are enlarged a little bit to have enough border
  data to calculate landscape descriptors as far as 26km away from extreme
  points inside the Morocco territory
  
* mseadist dataset is added
  
* The aurelhy object is added. It is the main object to perform the AURELHY
  interpolation, which is done using its predict() method. Methods print(),
  summary(), plot(), points() are also available. Methods update() and predict()
  are not implemented yet in this version.


== aurelhy version 0.1-3

* read.geomat(): the file is now read silently

* Bug correction is write.geomat(): the matrix was transposed

* read.geoshapes(): the function failed when coordinates where named 'X' and 'Y'
  instead of 'x' and 'y'. Also adde the possibility to read the DBF file at
  the same time ('dbf' attribute of the object)
  
* geoshapes objects now have a "dbf" attribute that holds the table of the
  associated DBF file

* It is now possible to supply custom attributes in plot.auremask()


== aurelhy version 0.1-2

* Addition of 'geoshapes' objects + read/write ESRI shapefiles and print(),
  lines() and points() methods for these objects

* Addition of a geoshapes example object (Morocco borders in mbord)

* Addition of an example geomask object (Morocco territory mask in mmask)

* Objects 'dem' are renamed 'geotm' for "georeferenced terrain model" for a more
  homogene naming in comparison with the other geo* objects


== aurelhy version 0.1-1

* There are now three grid objects: 'geomat', 'dem' and 'geomask'.

* More plot type as plot(), contour(), image() and persp() for 'geomat' objects.

* An example DEM object (Morocco with a grid of 1km x 1km roughly) is added.


== aurelhy version 0.1-0

This is the first version on R-forge.
